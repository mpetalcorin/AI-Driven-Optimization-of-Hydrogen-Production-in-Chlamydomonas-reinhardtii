# AI-Driven-Optimization-of-Hydrogen-Production-in-*Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii*
An Interactive, AI-Powered Dashboard for Sustainable Bioenergy

**Overview**\
We are simulating how artificial intelligence (AI) can control automated photobioreactors that grow the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* to produce hydrogen fuel.\
Hydrogen (H₂) is considered the fuel of the future because when you burn it, the only by-product is water, not carbon dioxide (CO₂). But naturally, algae are not very efficient hydrogen producers. Their internal hydrogen-producing enzymes, called [FeFe]-hydrogenases, stop working when there’s too much oxygen, and growth conditions need to be perfect.\
To overcome these natural limitations, we’re teaching AI to act like a lab scientist. It experiments with thousands of combinations of light, nutrients, oxygen, temperature, and pH and learns the best recipe for maximizing hydrogen yield while keeping the algae healthy.\
This is a proof-of-concept system that directly demonstrates the vision of teaching AI the “language of biology” to design and optimize living systems.\
This repository contains an AI-driven interactive dashboard designed to optimize hydrogen production in the green alga *C. reinhardtii*. Using machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and real-time visualization, this system simulates how an autonomous AI-driven photobioreactor could manage environmental conditions to maximize hydrogen yield while maintaining algal health.\
This proof-of-concept is aligned with the vision of teaching AI the “language of biology” and leveraging synthetic genomics, predictive modeling, and autonomous labs to engineer programmable organelles for bioenergy and biosustainability.

**How It Works**

This dashboard simulates an AI-controlled autonomous photobioreactor:\
	1.	Input: Environmental parameters from sliders.\
	2.	AI Core: Uses Optuna for Bayesian and multi-objective optimization.\
	3.	Prediction: Calculates hydrogen production using a biologically inspired model of *C. reinhardtii* metabolism.\
	4.	Visualization: Displays real-time predictions and the Pareto-optimal solution space.\
This approach integrates synthetic biology, AI-guided optimization, and automated lab control, demonstrating the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle in action.
