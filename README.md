# AI-Driven-Optimization-of-Hydrogen-Production-in-Chlamydomonas-reinhardtii
An Interactive, AI-Powered Dashboard for Sustainable Bioenergy

**Overview**
This repository contains an AI-driven interactive dashboard designed to optimize hydrogen production in the green alga *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*. Using machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and real-time visualization, this system simulates how an autonomous AI-driven photobioreactor could manage environmental conditions to maximize hydrogen yield while maintaining algal health.
This proof-of-concept is aligned with the vision of teaching AI the “language of biology” and leveraging synthetic genomics, predictive modeling, and autonomous labs to engineer programmable organelles for bioenergy and biosustainability.

**Features**
1. Interactive AI Dashboard
	•	Adjust six critical environmental parameters via sliders:
	•	Light intensity
	•	Blue-to-red light ratio
	•	Sulfur concentration
	•	Oxygen levels
	•	Temperature
	•	pH balance
	•	Real-time prediction of hydrogen yield displayed in dynamic charts.
2. Three AI Optimization Modes
	•	Local AI Optimize: Fine-tunes conditions near your current settings.
	•	Global AI Optimize: Searches the entire environmental space for the best possible hydrogen yield.
	•	Multi-Objective Optimize: Balances maximum hydrogen production and algal growth stability using Pareto-optimal solutions.
3. Real-Time 3D Pareto Explorer (Plotly)
	•	Interactive 3D visualization of the trade-off between:
	•	Hydrogen yield
	•	Algal growth potential
	•	Light intensity
	•	Rotate, zoom, and hover to explore AI-discovered solutions.
	•	Perfect for demonstrating the AI decision-making process to GBI reviewers and collaborators.

**How It Works**
This dashboard simulates an AI-controlled autonomous photobioreactor:
	1.	Input: Environmental parameters from sliders.
	2.	AI Core: Uses Optuna for Bayesian and multi-objective optimization.
	3.	Prediction: Calculates hydrogen production using a biologically inspired model of C. reinhardtii metabolism.
	4.	Visualization: Displays real-time predictions and the Pareto-optimal solution space.
This approach integrates synthetic biology, AI-guided optimization, and automated lab control, demonstrating the Design-Build-Test-Learn (DBTL) cycle in action.
